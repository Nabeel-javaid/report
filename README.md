# üõ†Ô∏è Phat Contract Runtime
**Coprocessor for blockchains.**

## Conceptual overview of the project:
The Phat Contract Runtime project is an innovative framework designed for the Phala Network, aiming to extend the capabilities of decentralized applications (dApps) by providing robust off-chain computation resources. At its core, it seeks to address the inherent limitations and high costs associated with on-chain computations, which often bottleneck blockchain technologies' scalability and practical utility. By moving complex or resource-intensive processes off-chain, while still ensuring the trustlessness and security blockchain technology is known for, Phat Contracts represent a significant step forward in decentralized computing.

The project introduces a seamless integration between on-chain smart contracts and off-chain computing tasks. Initially, users or dApps interact with smart contracts on the blockchain, which are inherently limited in their computational capabilities and suffer from high transaction fees. This is where the Phat Contract steps in; it acts as a bridge to off-chain computation, allowing for more complex, intensive operations without overburdening the blockchain or incurring prohibitive costs.

One of the most unique features of this framework is its ability to perform off-chain tasks while maintaining a trustless environment. This is achieved through a distributed network of off-chain workers operating within Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of the computation process. Users can, for example, initiate a task on-chain by calling a smart contract, which then delegates the task to off-chain workers. These workers perform the necessary computations and return the results to the blockchain, ensuring that the final output is verifiable and tamper-proof.

Another key functionality introduced by Phat Contracts is the capability to interact with external data sources directly. Traditional smart contracts cannot natively access off-chain data, which limits their utility in real-world applications. Phat Contracts overcome this by enabling off-chain workers to send HTTP requests, fetch data from external APIs, and incorporate this data into the blockchain ecosystem in a secure and decentralized manner. This opens up a myriad of possibilities for dApps, from fetching real-time market data for financial applications to integrating with web services for a broader range of functionalities.

## Approach Taken while auditing the codebase
When auditing the Smart Wallet protocol, I initiated the process with a comprehensive review of the project's documentation, focusing on the protocol's objectives, design patterns, and security mechanisms. This foundational understanding was crucial for appreciating the context and complexities of the protocol, particularly its integration with ERC-4337 standards and the innovative use of multi-ownership and WebAuthn technologies for enhanced security.

After this, I proceeded to analyze the smart contract codebase. Key contracts such as `CoinbaseSmartWallet.sol`, `MultiOwnable.sol`, `ERC1271.sol`, `MagicSpend.sol`, and others were scrutinized in detail. My aim was to understand the flow of transactions, the management of ownership rights, the execution of upgradeability patterns, and the verification processes for signatures and authentication.

Critical to my audit was the identification of security risks across various components. This included assessing vulnerability to common threats like reentrancy, improper handling of external calls, and potential flaws in signature verification processes. The unique aspects of the protocol, such as the cross-chain functionality and the handling of cryptographic operations in `FCL.sol`, required careful evaluation to ensure they did not introduce unintended security weaknesses.

Particular attention was given to the protocol‚Äôs upgradeability mechanism and its interaction with the `MagicSpend.sol` contract for gas management and fund withdrawals. I assessed how these features could be exploited or could lead to loss of funds if not properly secured. Additionally, I evaluated the robustness of multi-ownership management, ensuring that the protocol adequately protected against unauthorized changes in ownership or contract logic.

The audit also involved a thorough review of the protocol‚Äôs test suite. I looked for test coverage completeness, focusing on how well the tests addressed edge cases, potential race conditions, and the integrity of key functionalities like wallet creation, transaction execution, and owner management. Recommendations for additional tests or modifications were made to cover any identified gaps.

In conclusion, the approach taken while auditing the Smart Wallet protocol was thorough and multi-faceted, blending theoretical analysis with practical security assessments. The goal was to ensure the protocol's resilience against attacks, its compliance with Ethereum standards, and its reliability as a secure and user-friendly smart wallet.








### Systemic Risks

The Smart Wallet protocol introduces several advanced features and integrations to provide security, flexibility, and user convenience. However, like any complex system, it is not immune to systemic risks. Here are some identified risks specific to the protocol's architecture and functionalities:

1. **Upgradeability Mechanism**: While the use of UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard) in `CoinbaseSmartWallet.sol` allows for future improvements and bug fixes, it also introduces risks associated with centralized control over the upgrade process. If the upgrade function or the process is compromised, it could lead to the introduction of malicious code or vulnerabilities across all wallet instances.

2. **WebAuthn Integration Risks**: The integration of WebAuthn for authentication purposes (`WebAuthn.sol`) enhances security but also adds a layer of complexity that depends on external devices and services. This dependency could introduce risks related to device security, compatibility issues, or the failure of third-party services, impacting user access or transaction verification.

3. **Smart Contract Interactions and External Calls**: The protocol's interaction with external contracts, including ERC-4337 EntryPoint and other integrated services (e.g., for signature verification or fund management), could be vulnerable to exploitation if those external contracts are compromised. 

4. **Signature and Authentication Bypass**: Despite the robust implementation of signature verification (`ERC1271.sol`) and cryptographic operations (`FCL.sol`), any flaws in these critical components could allow attackers to bypass authentication checks, leading to unauthorized transactions or changes to wallet settings.



### Centralization Risks

Centralization risks stem from the roles and permissions granted to certain addresses within the protocol. 

**Upgradeability Centralization in `CoinbaseSmartWallet.sol`**

### Risk:
The protocol's reliance on upgradeability, allowing for future improvements and fixes, places significant power in the hands of those who can execute upgrades, potentially centralizing control.

```solidity
function _authorizeUpgrade(address newImplementation) internal view override onlyOwner {
}
```

**Single Point of Failure in Multi-Ownership Management (`MultiOwnable.sol`)**

### Risk:
The mechanism designed to distribute control among multiple owners can be compromised if the primary owner's credentials are compromised, leading to a centralized point of failure.

```solidity
function addOwnerAddress(address owner) public onlyOwner {
}

function removeOwnerAtIndex(uint256 index) public onlyOwner {
}
```

**Centralized Withdrawal Approval in `MagicSpend.sol`**

### Risk:
The `MagicSpend.sol` contract centralizes the withdrawal approval process, potentially enabling censorship or manipulation of fund access.

```solidity
function withdraw(WithdrawRequest memory withdrawRequest) external {
}
```

**Centralized Control over EntryPoint Deposits and Withdrawals (`MagicSpend.sol`)**

### Risk:
Exclusive control over interactions with the EntryPoint contract for deposits, withdrawals, and stake management introduces centralization, granting the owner undue influence over financial operations.

```solidity
function entryPointDeposit(uint256 amount) external payable onlyOwner {
}

function entryPointWithdraw(address payable to, uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
}
```




### Technical Risks

**Smart Contract Vulnerabilities:** Bugs or logical errors in the smart contracts can lead to loss of funds, unauthorized access, or unintended behavior. Given the complexity of contracts like the Shrine, interest rate models, and oracle interactions, the attack surface is significant.

**Scalability Concerns:** As transaction volumes grow, the platform must scale without compromising performance or security.


## New insights and learning of project from this audit:

The audit of the Smart Wallet protocol offered several valuable insights and learnings, emphasizing the protocol's innovative approach to wallet management, security, and interoperability within the Ethereum ecosystem. Here are key takeaways:

**Embracing ERC-4337 Standards**

The protocol's integration with the ERC-4337 standard for smart contract wallets marks a significant step towards achieving user-friendly and secure wallet solutions. This approach not only simplifies user interactions by removing the necessity for gas management but also opens avenues for advanced wallet functionalities like batch transactions and improved security mechanisms. 

**Advanced Security Through WebAuthn**

The utilization of WebAuthn for authentication purposes in `WebAuthn.sol` introduces a level of security typically reserved for traditional web applications into the blockchain domain. This fusion of web standards with blockchain technology not only enhances security but also demonstrates the protocol's commitment to adopting best practices from outside the blockchain world to mitigate common threats such as phishing and key theft.

**Upgradeability with User Sovereignty**

The careful implementation of upgradeability in `CoinbaseSmartWallet.sol` through UUPS showcases a thoughtful approach to maintaining and improving smart contract code while preserving user sovereignty. It serves as a learning point on balancing the need for future-proofing contracts with ensuring that upgrades do not compromise decentralized principles or user trust.
