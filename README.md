## a) Overview of the Althea Project
The AI Arena is a comprehensive blockchain-based ecosystem that integrates NFT (Non-Fungible Token) technology with competitive gaming and an innovative economic model. This ecosystem allows users to own, train, and compete with unique digital fighters represented as NFTs, engaging in ranked battles within a global competitive landscape. Central to its economy is the Neuron ($NRN) token, which facilitates transactions, staking, and rewards within the AI Arena.

**Key Components of the AI Arena:**

1. **NFT Fighters**: Players can acquire unique digital fighters as NFTs, each with distinct attributes and abilities. These fighters are central to the gameplay, as players train them to improve their stats and battle other players' fighters in the arena.

2. **Gaming Competitions**: AI Arena hosts ranked battles where players can enter their NFT fighters to compete against others. Success in these battles improves the player's and the fighter's global rankings, unlocking potential rewards and recognition within the community.

3. **Economic Model and $NRN Token**: The ecosystem is powered by the Neuron ($NRN) token, an in-game currency that players can earn, stake, and spend within the AI Arena. It is used for various purposes, including entering competitions, staking on outcomes, purchasing in-game items, and accessing special features or events.

4. **Staking and Rewards**: Players have the opportunity to stake $NRN tokens on their fighters or outcomes of battles, incentivizing active participation and investment in the game's economy. Staking mechanisms are designed to reward skill, strategy, and engagement, distributing $NRN tokens as rewards based on performance in competitions and other criteria.

5. **Merging Pool**: A unique feature of the AI Arena is the merging pool, where players can potentially upgrade their fighters by combining them with others. This process involves staking NFTs and $NRN tokens, offering a chance to obtain fighters with enhanced attributes and rarity.

## c) The approach I would follow when reviewing the code

First, by examining the scope of the code, I determined my code review and analysis strategy.
[https://code4rena.com/audits/2024-02-althea-liquid-infrastructure#top
](https://code4rena.com/audits/2024-02-ai-arena#top)
Accordingly, I would analyze and audit the subject in the following steps;

## d) Analysis of the code base

The most important summary in analyzing the code base is the stacking of codes to be analyzed.
In this way, many predictions can be made, including the difficulty levels of the contracts, which one is more important for the auditor, the features they contain that are important for security (payable functions, uses assembly, etc.), the audit cost of the project, and the time to be allocated to the audit;

## Setup

Clone with recurse:

```bash
git clone --recurse https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-ai-arena.git
```

Alternatively, if you have already cloned without recurse, do:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Install libraries using forge and compile contracts.

```bash
forge install

forge build
```

After installing and building contracts you can run this command to execute all the test scripts:

```bash
forge test
```

If you would like to execute an individual test script you could do so like this:

```bash
forge test --match-path test/AiArenaHelper.t.sol -vvvv
```

To print the gas report of contracts simply run:

```bash
forge test --gas-report
```

See code coverage by running this command:

```bash
forge coverage --ir-minimum
```


### What did the project do differently? ;
-   1) It can be said that the developers of the project did a quality job, there is a test structure consisting of tests with quality content. In particular, tests have been written successfully.

-   2) Overall line coverage percentage provided by your tests : 95.09%

### What could they have done better?

-  1) If we look at the test scope and content of the project with a systematic checklist, we can see which parts are good and which areas have room for improvement As a result of my analysis, those marked in green are the ones that the project has fully achieved. The remaining areas are the development areas of the project in terms of testing ;


[![test-cases.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/1zgD5wCt/test-cases.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/v1s40gdF)

-  2): It is recommended to increase the test coverage to 100% so make sure that each and every line is battle tested

## f) Security Approach of the Project

### Successful current security understanding of the project;

1- The project hasn't underwent any audit(nothing stated in the docs), this innovative assessments on Code4rena is the first one, where multiple auditors are scrutinizing the code.

### What the project should add in the understanding of Security;

1- By distributing the project to testnets, ensuring that the audits are carried out in onchain audit. (This will increase coverage)

2- Add On-Chain Monitoring System; If On-Chain Monitoring systems such as Forta are added to the project, its security will increase.

For example ; This bot tracks any DEFI transactions in which wrapping, unwrapping, swapping, depositing, or withdrawals occur over a threshold amount. If transactions occur with unusually high token amounts, the bot sends out an alert. https://app.forta.network/bot/0x7f9afc392329ed5a473bcf304565adf9c2588ba4bc060f7d215519005b8303e3

3- After the Code4rena audit is completed and the project is live, I recommend the audit process to continue, projects like immunefi do this. 
https://immunefi.com/

4- Emergency Action Plan
In a high-level security approach, there should be a crisis handbook like the one below and the strategic members of the project should be trained on this subject and drills should be carried out. Naturally, this information and road plan will not be available to the public.
https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1DaAiuGFkMEMMiIuvqhePL5aDFGHJ9Ya6D04rdaldqC0/mobilebasic#h.27dmpkyp2k1z

5- I also recommend that you have an "Economic Audit" for projects based on such complex mathematics and economic models. An example Economic Audit is provided in the link below;
Economic Audit with [Three Sigma](https://panoptic.xyz/blog/panoptic-three-sigma-partnership)

6 - As the project team, you can consider applying the multi-stage audit model.

[![sla.png](https://i.postimg.cc/nhR0kN3w/sla.png)](https://postimg.cc/Sn96Q1FW)

Read more about the MPA model;
https://mpa.solodit.xyz/

7 - I recommend having a masterplan applied to project team members (This information is not included in the documents).
All authorizations, including NPM passwords and authorizations, should be reserved only for current employees. I also recommend that a definitive security constitution project be found for employees to protect these passwords with rules such as 2FA. The LEDGER hack, which has made a big impact recently, is the best example in this regard;

## g) In-depth architecture assessment of business logic


The Althea Liquid Infrastructure project leverages blockchain technology to create a novel ecosystem for tokenizing real-world infrastructure assets, managing these assets, and distributing generated revenue. The project's architecture is meticulously designed to encapsulate the business logic central to its value proposition. This in-depth assessment focuses on the architecture's components, interactions, and the rationale behind the design choices, strictly within the domain of the project.

### Core Components

**1. Tokenization of Assets (NFTs):** The project uses Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to represent ownership and the unique characteristics of each real-world asset. This choice allows for the precise tracking of individual assets' performance and revenue generation. The `LiquidInfrastructureNFT.sol` contract is responsible for this, embedding the business logic for asset management, including revenue thresholds and withdrawals. This design choice enables a clear delineation between the asset and its financial operations, facilitating easier management and valuation.

**2. Revenue Distribution (ERC20 Tokens):** At the heart of the ecosystem is the `LiquidInfrastructureERC20.sol` contract, which embodies the business logic for aggregating revenue from assets (NFTs) and distributing it among token holders. This ERC20 token serves as a collective investment vehicle, allowing investors to buy into the infrastructure portfolio and receive dividends. The decision to implement an ERC20 token for this purpose stems from its suitability for creating a divisible, tradeable asset that can represent a stake in the revenue generated by the underlying assets.

**3. Regulatory Compliance and Security (Allowlist):** The project incorporates an allowlist mechanism within the ERC20 contract to ensure compliance with regulatory standards, such as KYC and AML. This feature is critical for maintaining the legitimacy and security of the investment platform, allowing only verified users to participate. This layer of business logic is crucial for operating within legal frameworks and protecting the integrity of the investment process.

### Architectural Interactions

The interaction between the NFT and ERC20 contracts forms the backbone of the project's business logic. Assets are tokenized into NFTs, each with its revenue-generation capabilities. The revenue is then pooled and distributed through the ERC20 tokens, linking the asset management component directly with investor returns. This architecture facilitates a direct correlation between the performance of individual assets and the dividends received by investors, embedding transparency and fairness into the business model.

The allowlist mechanism further interacts with the ERC20 token distribution process, ensuring that only eligible participants receive revenue. This interaction underscores the project's commitment to regulatory compliance and security, integrating these considerations seamlessly into the business logic.






















## h) Codebase Quality

Overall, I consider the quality of the Althea protocol codebase to be Good. The code appears to be mature and well-developed. We have noticed the implementation of various standards adhere to appropriately. Details are explained below:


| Codebase Quality Categories                | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Readability and Documentation**          | The codebase is well-documented with clear comments explaining the functionality of major components and functions. Naming conventions are consistent and descriptive, enhancing readability and making the codebase accessible to developers and auditors. |
| **Architecture and Design Patterns**       | The project employs a solid architectural design, separating concerns between asset tokenization (NFTs) and revenue distribution (ERC20 tokens). It effectively uses design patterns like Ownable for access control and ReentrancyGuard for security.    |
| **Security Practices**                     | Security is a strong focus, with the use of allowlists for compliance, checks-effects-interactions patterns to prevent reentrancy attacks, and visibility specifiers to control access to functions. However, a formal security audit report would further validate these practices.        |
| **Testing and Coverage**                   | The project exhibits an impressive commitment to quality and reliability, with test coverage around 95%. This high level of testing, encompassing unit and integration tests, signifies a robust approach to ensuring the functionality and security of the smart contracts against a wide array of potential issues. Such comprehensive testing is indicative of a mature development process and significantly contributes to the project's overall codebase quality.                               |
| **Upgradeability and Maintenance**         | The project does not explicitly implement upgradeability patterns (e.g., proxy contracts), which might impact long-term maintainability. Considering an upgrade path or versioning strategy could enhance the project's flexibility in addressing future requirements.                  |
| **Performance and Gas Optimization**       | The code demonstrates an awareness of gas optimization in some areas, such as using mappings for efficient data storage. However, the iterative nature of functions like `distribute` could be optimized for gas efficiency and scalability. 
## i) Other Audit Reports and Automated Findings 

**Previous Audits**
I've searched the docs and overview on code4rena but couldn't find any previous audit

**[Known issues and risks](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-althea-liquid-infrastructure/blob/main/bot-report.md)**
**[4naly3er Report](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-althea-liquid-infrastructure/blob/main/4naly3er-report.md)**


* Some of the variables in LiquidInfrastructureNFT.sol will have no effect on most EVM chains (in particular: `thresholdErc20s`, `thresholdAmounts`, `getThresholds()`, `setThresholds()`, and `recoverAccount()`).
These values and functions are all specific to deployment on Althea-L1 and will interact with Althea-L1's Cosmos module functionality. These contract elements are not out of scope, but the interaction between these elements and any Cosmos modules should not be considered.
* In order to simplify the distribution logic and accounting of LiquidInfrastructureERC20.sol, many contract functions periodically become blocked.
During a revenue distribution all token transfers should be blocked (including mints and burns).
If a distribution has not happened in at least `MinDistributionPeriod` blocks then all mints and burns should be blocked.

## k) Full representation of the project‚Äôs risk model

### Admin Abuse Risks

Admin Abuse Risks within the Althea project pertain to potential vulnerabilities and threats that stem from centralized control or misuse of administrative privileges within the smart contract ecosystem. These risks can compromise the integrity, security, and trust in the project.


1. **Centralized Control Over Allowlist Management**:
   The functionality for managing the allowlist, which controls who can buy, sell, or hold the ERC20 tokens, resides with the contract owner or admin. Misuse of this privilege can lead to unfair exclusion or inclusion, manipulation of token distribution, or preferential treatment.

   ```solidity
