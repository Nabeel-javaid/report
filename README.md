## a) Overview of the Decent Project

The Opus project is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform designed to offer users various financial services on the blockchain. It leverages smart contracts to enable activities such as collateralized lending, liquidity provision, and rewards distribution. Users can interact with the platform by depositing specific cryptocurrencies as collateral to participate in liquidity pools, earn rewards, or take out loans. The project focuses on security, scalability, and user experience, aiming to provide a comprehensive ecosystem for decentralized financial services.

### Key Features and Functionalities:

1. **Collateral Management**: Users can deposit various tokens (e.g., WBTC, ETH, wstETH) as collateral to participate in the platform's offerings.
2. **Liquidity Provision and Earning Rewards**: It facilitates liquidity provision to various pools, allowing users to earn rewards based on their contributions.
3. **Loan and Credit Facilities**: Offers mechanisms for users to take loans against their deposited collateral under certain conditions.
4. **Risk Management and Liquidation Protocols**: Implements safeguards and protocols for managing the health of assets and positions, including liquidation mechanisms for undercollateralized positions.
6. **PID Controller for Dynamic Adjustments**: Incorporates a PID controller for adaptive and dynamic adjustments within the system, enhancing stability and responsiveness.

## b) Technical Architecture:

Decent's architecture is built around a set of smart contracts, each serving specific roles:

## c) The approach I would follow when reviewing the code

First, by examining the scope of the code, I determined my code review and analysis strategy.
https://code4rena.com/audits/2024-01-saltyio

Accordingly, I would analyze and audit the subject in the following steps;

| Number |Stage |Details|Information|
|:--|:----------------|:------|:------|
|1|Compile and Run Test|[Installation](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-opus?tab=readme-ov-file#tests)|Test and installation structure is simple, cleanly designed|

## d) Analysis of the code base

The most important summary in analyzing the code base is the stacking of codes to be analyzed.
In this way, many predictions can be made, including the difficulty levels of the contracts, which one is more important for the auditor, the features they contain that are important for security (payable functions, uses assembly, etc.), the audit cost of the project, and the time to be allocated to the audit;

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/install.sh | sh -s -- -v 2.4.0
```
2. Install [Starknet Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/starknet-foundry) v0.13.1 by running:
```
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/foundry-rs/starknet-foundry/master/scripts/install.sh | sh

snfoundryup -v 0.13.1
```
3. Run `scarb test`.

### What did the project do differently? ;
-   1) It can be said that the developers of the project did a quality job, there is a test structure consisting of tests with quality content. In particular, tests have been written successfully.

-   2) Overall line coverage percentage provided by your tests : 90

### What could they have done better?

-  1) If we look at the test scope and content of the project with a systematic checklist, we can see which parts are good and which areas have room for improvement As a result of my analysis, those marked in green are the ones that the project has fully achieved. The remaining areas are the development areas of the project in terms of testing ;


[![test-cases.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/1zgD5wCt/test-cases.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/v1s40gdF)

Ref:https://xin-xia.github.io/publication/icse194.pdf

[![nabeel-1.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/6qtBdLQW/nabeel-1.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/bDVXPnbW)

-  2): It is recommended to increase the test coverage to 100% so make sure that each and every line is battle tested

## f) Security Approach of the Project

### Successful current security understanding of the project;

1- The project has already underwent an audits(stated in the docs), this innovative assessments on Code4rena is the second audit, where multiple auditors are scrutinizing the code.

According to the Docs, which can be found [here](https://demo-35.gitbook.io/untitled/security/external)

 `The core contracts found in opus_contracts directory have been audited by:`
- Trail of Bits

### What the project should add in the understanding of Security;

1- By distributing the project to testnets, ensuring that the audits are carried out in onchain audit. (This will increase coverage)

2- Add On-Chain Monitoring System; If On-Chain Monitoring systems such as Forta are added to the project, its security will increase.

For example ; This bot tracks any DEFI transactions in which wrapping, unwrapping, swapping, depositing, or withdrawals occur over a threshold amount. If transactions occur with unusually high token amounts, the bot sends out an alert. https://app.forta.network/bot/0x7f9afc392329ed5a473bcf304565adf9c2588ba4bc060f7d215519005b8303e3

3- After the Code4rena audit is completed and the project is live, I recommend the audit process to continue, projects like immunefi do this. 
https://immunefi.com/

4- Emergency Action Plan
In a high-level security approach, there should be a crisis handbook like the one below and the strategic members of the project should be trained on this subject and drills should be carried out. Naturally, this information and road plan will not be available to the public.
https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1DaAiuGFkMEMMiIuvqhePL5aDFGHJ9Ya6D04rdaldqC0/mobilebasic#h.27dmpkyp2k1z

5- I also recommend that you have an "Economic Audit" for projects based on such complex mathematics and economic models. An example Economic Audit is provided in the link below;
Economic Audit with [Three Sigma](https://panoptic.xyz/blog/panoptic-three-sigma-partnership)

6 - As the project team, you can consider applying the multi-stage audit model.

[![sla.png](https://i.postimg.cc/nhR0kN3w/sla.png)](https://postimg.cc/Sn96Q1FW)

Read more about the MPA model;
https://mpa.solodit.xyz/

7 - I recommend having a masterplan applied to project team members (This information is not included in the documents).
All authorizations, including NPM passwords and authorizations, should be reserved only for current employees. I also recommend that a definitive security constitution project be found for employees to protect these passwords with rules such as 2FA. The LEDGER hack, which has made a big impact recently, is the best example in this regard;

## g) Codebase Quality

Overall, I consider the quality of the Opus protocol codebase to be Good. The code appears to be mature and well-developed. We have noticed the implementation of various standards adhere to appropriately. Details are explained below:


| Codebase Quality Categories                | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Code Clarity and Readability**           | The codebase demonstrates good clarity and readability.
